    "bio": "I have been working in web development for several years now. The projects I have done were very minimal in comparison the the content and projects I have been working on recently. I have build and maintained several small business websites, and onlune stores. I decided in December of 2018 that I would focus on directing my path to a degree in FullStack Web Development. Since then I have built many little projects, both personal and for educational purposes. I am really interested in the Vue JS framework and hope to develope a fundimental understanding of it. Here are some of my current projects. There will be more added in the future.",
